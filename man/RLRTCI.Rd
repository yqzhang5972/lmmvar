\title{Confidence interval for a variance ratio by inverting a restricted likelihood ratio test.}
\usage{
RLRTCI(SimDists, ciseq, X, y, lambda, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{SimDists}{A list with simulated RLRT statistics for
each value to be considered for inclusion in the confidence interval. Usually each element in \code{SimDists} is a vector returned by running the function
\code{simulate_RLRT}.}

\item{ciseq}{A vector of potential values of \eqn{\tau} to be included in the confidence interval; the jth element in this vector corresponds to the jth
element of \code{SimDists}.}

\item{X}{An n-by-p matrix of predictors, n > p.}

\item{y}{A vector of length n of observed responses.}

\item{lambda}{A vector with eigenvalues of the variance component covariance
matrix (see details).}

\item{alpha}{A scalar in \eqn{(0,1)} indicating confidence level, default is 0.05.}
}
\value{
A vector of length 2 with endpoints of the confidence interval.
}
\description{
This function computes a confidence interval for \eqn{\tau = \sigma^2_g / \sigma^2_e} (see details) by inverting the restricted
likelihood ratio test-statistic using the sample quantiles from parametric bootstrap samples of the test-statistics under the null hypothesis.
}
\details{
The function assumes the model
\deqn{y \sim N(X \beta, \sigma_g^2 \Lambda + \sigma_e^2 I_n),} where \eqn{\Lambda} is a diagonal matrix with non-negative diagonal elements
supplied in the argument vector \code{lambda}.

The parameter of interest is \eqn{\tau =  \sigma^2_g / \sigma^2_e}.

See documention of \code{varTestRatio1d} for how this model often results from transforming more common ones using an eigendecomposition.
